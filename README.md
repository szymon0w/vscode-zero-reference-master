The project is appending all names of unused functions to the file result.txt in case of opening the code file with functions or changing the code file with functions. For now it is not checking if function is already saved in file.
To run extension in vscode:
1. Download project
2. In terminal run commands
  npm install
  npm run build
  
TODO:
- for now it is not working until opening typescript file than it starts to work
